 1. `dynamic_statistics`
 2. `performance_prediction`
 3. `performance_memory`

# Datas

Since the time of computation can be long, the folder `results` also includes the csv 
of experiments used to produce some of the plots in the aforementioned article. 

# Analysis of the data

The analyses performed in the article are not yet available in this version of the code.
